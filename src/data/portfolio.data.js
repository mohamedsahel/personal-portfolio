        "Since the first time I put my hands on coding back to my sixteens, I was and still fascinating by the power of programming, yes it’s between the most powerful things humanity invent and develop, programmers know very well what I mean", 

        "The power of making every  idea that comes to my imagination into a real world application is a super power in my opinion .. Marvel; enough batman, and spiderman .. it's time for codeman. hhhh yes i am serious",

        "To be honest programming it's not always an enjoyable thing, sometimes when I struggle in a very hard problem, I feel that I am the worst developer in the world .. only that feeling can make leave and never go back to the city of coding .. but when you have passion nothing can stop you from coding. Again programmers know very well what I mean",
