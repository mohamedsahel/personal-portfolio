        "Since the first time I put my hands on coding back to my sixteens, I was and still fascinating by the power of programming, yes it‚Äôs between the most powerful things humanity invent and develop, programmers know very well what I mean", 

        "The power of making every  idea that comes to my imagination into a real world application is a super power in my opinion.  Marvel; enough Batman, and Spiderman .. it's time for codeman. üòÖüòÖ yes I am serious",

        "To be honest programming is not always an enjoyable thing, sometimes when I struggle in a very hard problem, I feel that I am the worst developer in the world .. only that feeling can make you leave and never go back to the city of coding .. but when you have passion üòç, nothing can stop you from coding. Again programmers know very well what I mean",

        "Internet is the future of humanity, and programmers are the future of the internet, We are the future of humanity (hahaha mathematical concept . . . forget). are you a programmer ? get your laptop and let‚Äôs rule the world üòà,..  no no let‚Äôs make the world better; that‚Äôs enough üòâ"
